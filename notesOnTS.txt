filiks notes on ts
-------------------

- writing ts is the same as js with some 'extra documentation'
- typescript has no effect on how our code gets executed by the browser or node
- its acting like a friend / pair-programmer / realtime-error-linter

run ts copiler on node:
tsc index.ts

--> convert to index.js

def:  Type Annotation:
  Code we add to tell Typescript what type of value a variable will refer to

def: Type inference:
Typescript tries to (automaticly) figure out what [THE HELL] type of value a variable refers to.
