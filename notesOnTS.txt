filiks notes on ts
-------------------

- writing ts is the same as js with some 'extra documentation'
- typescript has no effect on how our code gets executed by the browser or node
- its acting like a friend / pair-programmer / realtime-error-linter

run ts copiler on node:
tsc index.ts

--> convert to index.js
